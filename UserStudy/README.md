This directory contains all the resources used throughout the user study as well as the individual answers.
### Directory Structure
The two folders both contain all the artifacts used throughout the user study:

- The AuthorProcesses folder contains the xml versions of the processes, both a version with violations and a version without violations. In addition there is a .svg of the version with violations. If users want to look at the processes directly in the cpee they can also check them out [here](https://cpee.org/hub/?stage=development&dir=Staff.dir/Loebbi.dir/Compliance.dir/User%20Study.dir/)
- The folder\_name.log is the log returned by the PTV when verifying the Process with violations
- info.txt contains a textual description of the process including which activities are part of the process
- requirements.json contains the encoded requirements of the process.
- Screenshots contains screenshots of the CPEE version of the process including the .svg file that was provided to participants in the survey with basic explanations of how to interpret CPEE processes.

### Additional Details on User Study
The best way to identify additional details on the User Study is really to go through. Accordingly you can try it out for yourself for both [Group B](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/wLxH3TRQyK) and [Group A](https://forms.cloud.microsoft/r/v5hEQgxY7t). As expected, once you click on Submit we will collect the information which you provided to the forms and will potentially consider these for future improvements to the PTV and include them in a evaluation. However no additional information on your person is collected and if you do not submit you can view the survey questions without any data being transmitted.

With the resources in this directory it is obviously possible to "cheat" on the survey so if you submit the data we kindly ask you to not cheat beforeheand.



A detailed overview of the User Study results can be found in the following [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dAwLLT-TmykWrtv1xQR3bZfH6KmgmvfXNJW27LZg940/edit?usp=sharing).
The second column represents the violations that were intendended by the authors, while the other columns represent the answers that were given by the participants. Green cells represent correct results, while red represents mistakes. A particular case are the blue cells, where the result differs from the results intended by the authors, but the argumentation was solid such that it was not counted as a mistake. Since these appear more in the cases where the participants were NOT supported by the PTV, they negatively affect the evaluation results so we do not overestimate the usability. In this table you can also verify the total results reported in the Paper.
