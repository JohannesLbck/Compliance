Verifying Requirement R0: precedence(tree, 'obtain consent', 'provide information')
Activity "provide information" was found before "obtain consent", so precedence "obtain consent" requires "provide information" before is True
Result: Requirement R0 is True
Verifying Requirement R1: data_value_alternative_directly_follows(tree, 'not data.consented', 'terminate')
Found no branch which matches to notdata.consented
No branch with condition: "not data.consented" was found
Result: Requirement R1 is False
Verifying Requirement R2: directly_follows(tree, 'Start Activity', 'verify identity')
Activity "verify identity" directly follows Activity "Start Activity" is True
Result: Requirement R2 is True
Verifying Requirement R3: executed_by(tree, 'verify identity', 'trained assistant')
Activity "verify identity" does not have an annotation Resource "trained assistant"
Result: Requirement R3 is False
Verifying Requirement R4: data_value_alternative_eventually_follows(tree, 'assessment_status == "physician"', 'direct questions')
Condition mapped via in compared to ==, lower assurances
While Branch following condition "assessment_status == "physician"" was found, the Activity "direct questions" was not found on the branch
Result: Requirement R4 is False
Verifying Requirement R5: executed_by(tree, 'direct questions', 'physician')
Activity "direct questions" is executed by Resource "physician"
Result: Requirement R5 is True
Verifying Requirement R6: activity_receives(tree, 'conduct interview','assessment_status') and activity_receives(tree, 'conduct questionnaire','assessment_status') and activity_receives(tree, 'direct questions','assessment_status')
data object "assessment_status" is finalized from Activity "conduct interview"
data object "assessment_status" is finalized from Activity "conduct questionnaire"
data object "assessment_status" is finalized from Activity "direct questions"
Result: Requirement R6 is True
Verifying Requirement R7: data_value_alternative_eventually_follows(tree, 'assessment_status == "rejected"', 'inform of rejection') and data_value_alternative_eventually_follows(tree, 'assessment_status == "deferred"', 'inform of deferral')
Condition mapped via in compared to ==, lower assurances
Activity "inform of rejection" was found on branch following condition "assessment_status == "rejected""
Found no branch which matches to assessment_status=="deferred"
No branch with condition: "assessment_status == "deferred"" was found
Result: Requirement R7 is False
Verifying Requirement R8: directly_follows(tree, 'retract consent', 'terminate') and parallel(tree, 'retract consent', 'conduct interview') and parallel(tree, 'retract consent', 'conduct questionnaire')
Found a terminate that directly follows "retract consent"
Activities "retract consent" and "conduct interview" are in parallel
Activities "retract consent" and "conduct questionnaire" are in parallel
Result: Requirement R8 is True
