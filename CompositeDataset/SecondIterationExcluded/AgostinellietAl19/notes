no directl requirements are found, but they describe several requirements from GDPR, so extracted those manually, it is already obvious that the manually extracted requirements do not really fit the process at all (which was also not really the intention of the authors, they just wanted to show a example process first and then show at what points it would have to be extended) they also have BPM models of all the requirements, but those are generic, not processes of anythign happening but just generic how this rule looks like in bpm
