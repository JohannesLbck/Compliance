The process in the paper is unimaginably simple and not conforming to BPM at all (directly follows graph), the requirements are a lot of types of patterns, none of which can really be verified on the process ==> Create two processes, one which is just the ultra generic one from the image and one that is more expressive by partly looking at the requirements

The original requirements being true or false does not apply
