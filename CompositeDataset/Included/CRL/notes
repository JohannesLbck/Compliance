Their process is a bit confusing since it uses swimlanes and message exchanges, however it looks like its a single instance process (not a collaborative) and several moments would not need a message exchange. The swimlanes are basicially just used to indicate resources. There are also several deadlocks such as a parallel where one side will infinitly wait for a message that will never arrive, while the other side is already finished.

R1 is an example of a requirement that would (normally) require looking into an endpoint
