this is one of the only processes with subprocesses, but they are not really needed, if you make a loop then the complete process is still pretty small even without dividing into subprocesses. I will again create both the version that has subprocesses and is accordingly closer to the source and the cleaned version that is just one process using a loop (and is also more flexibly because of it)
