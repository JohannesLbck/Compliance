This Directory contains the composite dataset Directory:
### Directory Structure
This directory contains several folders for each process part of the composite dataset, where each folder contains the requirements in plain text, encoded as ASTs as well as the xml of the process. In addition some folders contain a additional notes.txt file that contains short notes on particular inclusion/exclusion/transformation decisions. Further details are also in the google sheet linked below. There is one additional folder for processes that were initially included but excluded in a second iteration.


### Dataset Creation
The dataset was created by analyzing the examples in 20 related contributions with the following criteria for Exclusion:
A) The contribution does not contain a example process
B) The contribution does not contain example requirements
C) The Example process and the example requirements are not related (i.e. the requirements can not be checked on the process)

The contributions were choosen by first analyzing seminal contribution for compliance (100+ citations) and then adding processes to the dataset until no new CP were required for the previous 3 additions. After analyzing 20 contributions and including 11 no new CP were added in the last 3 processes so we finished increasing the dataset.

An overview of all analyzed contributions for this dataset creation can be found in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fDf-lSw2ICQe86C-97KKDQrR5Dca5_-2ycjm7HDUTcY/edit?usp=sharing).
