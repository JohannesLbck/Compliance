## Methods for parsing the Requirements from whatever language we choose
import json
import re

## when using the "language" I used, only this tiny bit of replacement is needed, but this could be replaced with an extensive dictionary to enable a mapping between any language and the code 
method_dict = {
    "prohibition": "not ",
    "root": "Start Activity",
    "end": "End Activity",
}


#parses the requirements into requirements that can be passed to the AST
def parse_requirements(req):
    req = re.sub(r'=>', ':', req)

    eval_req = []
    for tag, content in req.items():
        eval_req.append(parse_req(content))
